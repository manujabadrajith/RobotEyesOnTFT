# What is Robot Eyes On TFT ?

Well, it is a project to bring the classic Robot Eyes onto the TFT display platform.

### What does this project has to offer ?

Currently blinking and gazing is supported, more effects will be added in the future ( only if i figure out how to 🫠 )

### How does it work ?

This project uses Sprite function to create animations in the ESP's ram and uses PushSprite method to push the animation onto the screen.
I do not know well on how to explain the thing but this is what it sums up to.

# Where do I get started ?

Well, you need to get the source code.zip file from the releases tab. Extract it and open up the TFT-Eyes.ino file from the Arduino IDE ( latest build...older ones will work ig )
and flash it to your ESP. You will need to install the TFT_eSPI library via Arduino IDE's library manager and configure it to work with your ESP32 and your screen of choice. You can read the code for yourself and most of the things are commented so it will be easy to figure out the process for yourself.

### What will you need ?
1. Any kind of ESP32 ( Esp32 S3 works better since it has PSRAM by default )
2. A TFT Screen ( mine is 240 × 280, you will need atleast a screen on this pixel ratio )
3. Some jumper wires
4. A breadboard to place things up
5. A lot of patience ( well not that much 🥲 )

### ----- ESP32 S3 SPECIAL NOTICE -----

Esp32 S3 has a different method to flash, means you need to add few commands to your TFT_eSPI library to make it work well with the TFT screen.
These commands are mentioned in the .ino file so read it carefully before proceeding. Every other ESP32 will work just fine ( i have tested with both Wroom32u
and S3 supermini and both worked as expected ). NodeMCU devices such as Esp8266/D1 Mini ARE NOT tested, so results are not guaranteed.

### How to install 🤔

1. Download the project from this github repository.
2. Extract and open TFT_Eyes.ino.
3. Go to Tools on the arduino IDE, disable USB CDC on boot, choose PSRAM type as QSPI &
choose board type as ESP32S3 development module if you are on S3.
4. Go to library manager, search for TFT_eSPI ( from Bodmer ) and install it. Then go to arduino installation directory, find the folder called ' Libraries '.
5. Inside it move to TFT_eSPI folder and paste User_setup_select.h, this will ask to overwrite the existing file, choose YES.
6. Go to User_Setup folder which exists inside the TFT_eSPI folder and paste the Setup203_ST7789.h.
7. Save changes, click install on Arduino IDE, wait for the installation and you are good to go.

# Final thoughts

I am no expert in coding and my oled screen going to shadow realm inspired me to make this project. ( LOL 🥸😅 ). As well as i made a lot ( an actual lot ) 
of mistakes whilst in the process and ChatGPT ( GOATGPT 🗿 ) helped me overcome those struggles. KUDOS FOR THAT THING FOR IT'S S TIER WORK ♡. 
Thank you a lot for testing this project out, if you have any suggestions/improvements please let me know. Enjoy!!!
